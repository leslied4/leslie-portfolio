In the course of the bachelor's I took three internships at Nfortics Financial Technology Services, a company which employs both web and mobile application development. I am currently employed as a software developer at Nfortics Financial Technology Services and a part time software developer for Firstline24. Shoutout to Selase Krakani at Nfortics for being a mentor to me and teaching me most of what I know today. I like to say i am mainly backend developer and a hobby front end developer. But when the call comes i can even build spaceshipsðŸ˜‚."
